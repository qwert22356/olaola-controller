# OlaOla ‚Äì The First Network That Speaks Human  
**Finally, a Network That Understands You.**
<br>

## üåê Why Symbiotic Network?

Traditional networking is broken:

- **CLI Issues**  
  Rigid syntax, high learning curve, error-prone commands.

- **GUI Issues**  
  Slow workflows, poor auditability, inefficient operations.

- **Controllers**  
  Vendor lock-in leads to opaque, complex systems.

- **Open-source Tools**  
  Powerful yet fragmented, with steep learning curves.
<br>

## üå™Ô∏è **Root Cause:**  
> "The network doesn't understand you."

## üß¨ **OlaOla's Mission:**  
> **"Make the network understand you."**
<br>
