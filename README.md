# OlaOla ‚Äì The First Network That Speaks Human  
**Finally, a Network That Understands You.**
<br>

## üåê Why Symbiotic Network?

Traditional networking is broken:

- **CLI Issues**  
  Rigid syntax, high learning curve, error-prone commands.

- **GUI Issues**  
  Slow workflows, poor auditability, inefficient operations.

- **Controllers**  
  Vendor lock-in leads to opaque, complex systems.

- **Open-source Tools**  
  Powerful yet fragmented, with steep learning curves.
<br>

## üå™Ô∏è **Root Cause:**  
> "The network doesn't understand you."

## üß¨ **OlaOla's Mission:**  
> **"Make the network understand you."**

## OlaOla Controller installation Guide

## Node.js and npm needed
- curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
- apt install -y nodejs
- node -v  
- npm -v

## Step1: install Frontend
# Frontend - Setup and run the frontend application:

- cd frontend                      # Navigate to frontend directory
- npm install                      # Install all dependencies
- npm run start                    # Start the development server

## Step2: install FastAPI
# Used for Telemetry Agent
'''bash
- cd fastapi                       # Navigate to fastapi directory
- docker-compose up -d             # Start FASTAPI Service
'''

Step3: install Supabase
## Supabase
# Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. Follow these steps to set it up:

- cd supabase                      # Navigate to supabase directory
- brew install supabase/tap/supabase   # Install Supabase CLI using Homebrew
- supabase init                    # Initialize a new Supabase project
- supabase start                   # Start the Supabase services locally
- supabase status                  # Find your Service Role Secret here
- psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/init/schema.sql   # Import database schema
- psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/init/seed.sql     # Import initial data

# Important notes:
# - Database password is: postgres
# - After running 'supabase start' for the first time, visit http://localhost:54323 
# - Make sure schema and seed data are imported before creating database content
# - Localhost is your IP address of OlaOla Controller.

Step4: install N8N
## N8N
# N8N is a workflow automation tool. Follow these steps to set it up:

- cd n8n                           # Navigate to n8n directory
- mkdir -p ./data                  # Create a data directory for n8n
- sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./data   # Set proper permissions for the data directory
- docker compose up -d             # Start n8n using Docker in detached mode
- docker exec -it n8n-v2 sh        # login n8n docker to import workflows
bash
for f in /home/node/workflows/*.json; do
  n8n import:workflow --input "$f"
done
- go to n8n link like : http://localhost:5678/setup and register a name for local login
- Active each flow   # Turn on the active button for each workflow
- Go to Credentials 
    - Click top right corner ‚ñº Create Credentials 
    - Add new credential - supabase API 
        - Host:http://host.docker.internal:54321 
        - Service Role Secret: ## Look at Step3
    - Add new credential - Postgre
        - Host: host.docker.internal
        - Database:postgres
        - User:postgres
        - Password:postgres
        - Port:54322
    - Add Bearer Auth
        - Bearer Token:changeme-secret-token          # Get here: ./fastapi/docker-compose.yaml -> AGENT_TOKEN
