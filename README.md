# OlaOla – The First Network That Speaks Human  
**Finally, a Network That Understands You.**

---

## 🌐 Why Symbiotic Network?

Traditional networking is broken:

- **CLI Issues**  
  Rigid syntax, high learning curve, error-prone commands.

- **GUI Issues**  
  Slow workflows, poor auditability, inefficient operations.

- **Controllers**  
  Vendor lock-in leads to opaque, complex systems.

- **Open-source Tools**  
  Powerful yet fragmented, with steep learning curves.

**Root Cause:**  
> "The network doesn't understand you."

**OlaOla's Mission:**  
> **"Make the network understand you."**
